Hi. I am Matthew Batchelder from Matthew's Development.

Was previously the creator of the Bowser, Sonic Bot, and Geometry Dash Demon. We now only make the Cat Bot and Baldi Bot (which was originally called Baldi's Basics Bot) on Discord and Revolt. We even make games and software for Fun and usefulness like the Malicious Site Blocker and SHADOW OS. We also run a Minecraft Java Edition Forge server that is city themed.
